# Generators

    The latest addition to generators is from Allen Downey's Descrete Structuures (thanks for the free books) At the bottom of the notebook
  is a generator that produces the cartesian product for arbitrary number of arguments using iteration.

  
  
    The older problems are practice on generators.  The rolling average function calculates the ...rolling average (as defined in Wikipedia).
  
  The trange function/generator " generates a sequence of time tuples from start to stop incremented by step. A time tuple is a 3-tuple of integers: (hours, minutes, seconds) " (quote from python-course.eu, one of the practice problems on generators.
  
  The following versions of trange correspond to the other problems. One can receive a message and reset to start.
  The last trange version generates times (from 6:00:00  increments by 90 secs) and random temperatures from a fixed bracket (10.0 - 25.0).
  
  
  
  My thanks to the author of python-course.eu, Bernd Klein for his website and the good problems.
