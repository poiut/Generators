# Generators
  These are practice problems on generators.  
  
  The rolling average function calculates the ...rolling average (as defined in Wikipedia).
  
  The trange function/generator " generates a sequence of time tuples from start to stop incremented by step. A time tuple is a 3-tuple of integers: (hours, minutes, seconds) " (quote from python-course.eu, one of the practice problems on generators.
  
  The following versions of trange correspond to the other problems. One can receive a message and reset to start.
  
  The last trange version generates times (from 6:00:00  increments by 90 secs) and random temperatures from a fixed bracket (10.0 - 25.0).
  
  
  
  My thanks to the author (Bern Klein) of python-course.eu for his website and the good problems.
